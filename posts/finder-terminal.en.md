## 1 From Terminal to Finder
To open Terminal's current directory in Finder, use `open .`. The `open` command is versatile --- you can use it to open other directories, files, or launch applications.


## 2 From Finder to Terminal
Here, we'll register a shortcut key to open Finder directories in Terminal. First, open [System settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services].

Then, check the box in the red frame below and register a shortcut key (here, :btn[cmd] + :btn[shift] + :btn[E]).

To actually open Terminal from Finder, either select a directory in Finder and use the shortcut key, or right-click and select one of the options in the red frame below.

## 3 Moving to Finder's Current Directory in Terminal
Here's a useful shell function. When using Terminal, you might want to navigate to the directory currently open in Finder. This can be achieved with the `cdf` command below. (Quoted from [this page](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles/blob/master/system/.function.macos).)
If you want to use it, add it to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.

```shell
# Change working directory to the top-most Finder window location
cdf() {
    cd "$(osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)')";
}
```

For example, in the image below, Terminal was initially in `Desktop`, but after executing `cdf`, it moved to the `Google` folder that was open in Finder.

## 4 From Finder to VScode
You often want to open Finder folders in VScode. It would be convenient to open selected folders with a shortcut key. Here, we'll create such a shortcut using Automator.app's Quick Action.

First, open Automator.app and select Quick Action.

Next, change the red-framed parts to "files and folders" in "Finder".

Then, type "open" in the left search box. When "Open Finder Items" appears in the suggestions, drag and drop it to the right. Select VScode within it.

After completing these steps, save it with a name like "Open in VScode".

Finally, assign a shortcut key to this Quick Action.
Open System Settings and navigate to [System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > Files and Folders]. You'll find "Open in VScode" that you just created. Assign a shortcut key (here, :btn[cmd] + :btn[shift] + :btn[W]).

Once done, try selecting a folder in Finder and pressing the shortcut key. VScode should open instantly.
