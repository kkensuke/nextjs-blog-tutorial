## 0. Firefox is Quite User-Friendly
While new browsers are constantly being hyped, after using all available browsers, I find Firefox to be quite convenient. I'm writing this article as a thank you to the developers. If you haven't tried it yet, please [install it](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and give it a try.

![Firefox Screenshot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/a80af07f-48ce-5173-c6ef-8203769de4fe.png)



## 1. Changing Settings
You can open the preferences page with :btn[cmd] + :btn[,]. Initially, it's good to import data from the browser you're currently using. You can also adjust other settings to your preference on this page.

![Settings Screenshot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/e1d72bc2-3ec1-2a16-bbce-7a1917f1eaac.png)



## 2. Useful Features
Below is a simple list of Firefox's useful features. Some of these are explained in more detail later.

1. [Rich extensions (add-ons)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

2. Easily customizable toolbar. Right-click on the toolbar and select "Customize Toolbar" to see the following screen. You can add and remove icons using drag and drop.
    ![Toolbar Customization](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/a9a7b421-b8ce-c5df-6ccf-66c7e65bcd22.png)
    
3. Sidebar: Provides easy access to various information:
    - Bookmarks
    - Browsing history
    - Synced tabs
    - `Simple Tab Groups` (extension)
    You can group and organize tabs. Tabs are saved even when you close the window.
    - AI Chatbot: Check `AI chatbot` in the `Firefox Labs` section of the settings page. If you check `Show prompts on text select`, you can immediately send selected text to your specified language model on any site.
![AI Chatbot](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/1cf9631d-ee94-7fa8-a753-b69aede5628b.png)

4. Multi-Account Containers
You can log in to the same site with different accounts simultaneously. For example, in one tab, you can log in to a site with your work account, and in another tab, you can log in to the same site with your personal account.

5. Screenshots: :btn[cmd] + :btn[shift] + :btn[S]
You can select the range of screenshots in four ways:
    - Select the range yourself
    - Automatically select part of the page where the cursor is
    - Select the entire visible range
    - Select the entire scrollable range
![Screenshot Tool](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/90edc24f-23d0-6f96-520c-d8a829745611.png)

6. Reader View: :btn[opt] + :btn[cmd] + :btn[R]
Removes unnecessary elements from web pages and improves readability.

7. Device synchronization

8. Customize the browser's appearance with `userChrome.css`.




## 3. [Add-ons (Extensions)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
:::warning
Certain combinations of add-ons may cause unexpected behavior. In such cases, temporarily disable the suspected add-on, restart Firefox, and see which add-on is causing the issue. Once you identify which add-ons are conflicting, it's good to report the issue on the GitHub repository.

For dark mode background in the PDF viewer, see section `4 about:config`.
```

## 8. Conclusion
Above, I've introduced Firefox based on my personal experience. If you know of other good features, please let me know in the comments.
By the way, many of the Firefox add-ons introduced here are also available as Chrome extensions, so if you often use Chrome, feel free to look for them.
