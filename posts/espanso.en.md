## [Espanso](https://espanso.org/)
- Espanso is an open-source, free-to-use, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) snippet app.
- By simply typing short keywords, you can instantly input long text. This makes it easy to type text that needs to be entered repeatedly.
- It's faster and more feature-rich than Mac's standard text dictionary.
- Furthermore, since it can call shell scripts, it's not just a snippet app - it has very high extensibility, allowing you to open apps and files, call APIs, and more.
    - For example, you can instantly translate text copied to the clipboard using an LLM API without having to leave your current application.

## Installation
:::linkcard
https://espanso.org/docs/install/mac/
:::


After installation, open the app. Then open the terminal and run the command `espanso status` to check if it's running.

## Configuration
:::linkcard
https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/
:::

Espanso configuration is mainly done through two files.

```sh
espanso/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ match/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ base.yml
```

The location of the `espanso` directory varies by OS and can be checked with the command `espanso path`.

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/espanso` (e.g. `/home/user/.config/espanso`)
- MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/espanso` (e.g. `/Users/user/Library/Application Support/espanso`)
- Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\espanso` (e.g. `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\espanso`)


There's nothing particularly to configure in the `config/default.yml` file at first.
If you want to hide the menu bar icon, you can write `show_icon: false`.


## Usage
Snippet configuration is written in the `match/base.yml` file.

Basically, you write with the following syntax:
```yml
matches: 
  - trigger: ";hello"
    replace: "world"

# Multiple lines
  - trigger: ";hello"
    replace: "line1\nline2"

# Multiple lines
  - trigger: ";include newlines"
    replace: |
              exactly as you see
              will appear these three
              lines of poetry

# No newlines
  - trigger: ";fold newlines"
    replace: >
              this is really a
              single line of text
              despite appearances
```

After modifying `match/base.yml`, reload it by clicking `Reload` in the menu bar or executing the command `espanso restart`.

:::warning
To prevent unwanted snippet activation, it's good to use symbols like `:` or `;` that you don't normally use as prefixes. This article uses `;`.
:::

:::warning
If you register `;a`, triggers like `;as` or `;ad` won't work. This is because when you type `;a`, it gets replaced with different text. To prevent this, it's better to avoid setting triggers that are too short.
:::

:::tip
All `.yml` files in the `match` directory are loaded, so you can split files finely according to their purpose.
:::


## Dynamic Matches
With the following configuration, typing `;now` converts to something like `It's 11:29` showing the current time.

```yml
  - trigger: ";now"
    replace: It's {{mytime}}
    vars:
      - name: mytime
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%H:%M"
```

## Word Match
With the basic `trigger` and `match` configuration method, conversions might occur when you don't want them. For example, when you want to convert to `there` with the trigger `ther`, if you type `other`, the conversion will execute and become `othere`. To prevent this, add the `word: true` option as follows:

```yml
  - trigger: "ther"
    replace: there
    word: true
```

## Cursor Hint
You can determine where the cursor comes after text conversion with `$|$`.

```yml
  - trigger: ";div"
    replace: <div>$|$</div>
```


## Multiple Replacements for One Trigger

```yml
  - trigger: ";quote"
    replace: "Every moment is a fresh beginning."
  - trigger: ";quote"
    replace: "Everything you can imagine is real."
  - trigger: ";quote"
    replace: "Whatever you do, do it well."
```

## One Replacement for Multiple Triggers
```yml
  - triggers: [";hello", ";hi"]
    replace: "world"
```

## Multiple Replacements for Multiple Triggers
```yml
  - triggers: [";ok",";emoji"]
    replace: "üëç"
  - triggers: [";ok",";emoji"]
    replace: "‚úÖ"
  - triggers: [";up",";emoji"]
    replace: "‚¨ÜÔ∏è"
  - triggers: [";down",";emoji"]
    replace: "‚¨áÔ∏è"
```

## Image Match

```yml
  - trigger: ";cat"
    image_path: "$CONFIG/images/cat.png"
```


## Global Variables
If there are variables commonly used across `match`, setting them as global variables is convenient for making changes.

```yml
global_vars:
  - name: myname
    type: echo
    params:
      echo: "John"
# It can also be defined as follows:
#  - name: myname
#    type: shell
#    params:
#      cmd: "echo John"

matches:
  - trigger: ";greet"
    replace: "Hello {{myname}}"

  - trigger: ";sig"
    replace: "Best regards, {{myname}}"
```


If you want to manage the espanso directory on GitHub but have some private information, you can put it as global variables in `params.yml` and add `params.yml` to `.gitignore`. All `*.yml` files in the `match` directory are loaded. Otherwise, you can also import by specifying the path directly.


```sh
espanso/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ match/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.yml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ params.yml
    ...
```


```yml[title=params.yml]
# Adding this file to .gitignore is safe
global_vars:
  - name: MY_API
    type: echo
    params:
      echo: "EmitDqIhb7Rzu5GheVtiwL452..."
```

```yml[title=base.yml]
# YML file outside of espanso/match/
imports:
  - "paths/to/your.yml"

matches:
  - trigger: ";myapi"
    replace: "{{MY_API}}"
```


## Clipboard Extension
You can include clipboard contents in the output after conversion. This eliminates the need for pasting operations.

For example, when you want to create an HTML `<a>` tag using a recently copied link, define the trigger as follows:
```yml
  - trigger: ";aref"
    replace: "<a href='{{clip}}' />$|$</a>"
    vars:
      - name: "clip"
        type: "clipboard"
```

Markdown trigger examples:
```yml
  - trigger: ";mdlink"
    replace: "[$|$]({{clip}})"
    vars:
      - name: "clip"
        type: "clipboard"

  - trigger: ";mdcode"
    replace: |
          ```
          {{clip}}
          ```
    vars:
      - name: "clip"
        type: "clipboard"
```

:::tip
If you find it tedious to define clipboard variables for each trigger, it's good to define it in `global_vars` as follows:
```yml
global_vars:
  - name: "clip"
    type: "clipboard"

matches:
  - trigger: ";mdlink"
    replace: "[$|$]({{clip}})"
```
:::


## Shell Extension
You can also execute shell commands and output the results.

```yml
  - trigger: ";shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
```

The following example is a trigger that gets your public IP from ipify.
```yml
  - trigger: ";ip"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "curl 'https://api.ipify.org'"
```

The following example is a trigger that generates a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
```yml
  - trigger: ";uuid"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
    - name: output
      type: shell
      params:
        # macOS,Linux:
        cmd: "uuidgen"
        # Windows (requires PowerShell):
        # cmd: "powershell -command \"[guid]::NewGuid().ToString()\""
```

The following multiple examples are triggers to open apps, websites, and files, which differ from the original purpose of the app.

First, triggers to open the terminal or specific folders.
```yml
  - trigger: ";term"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "open -a Terminal.app"

  - trigger: ";dotfile"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "open ~/dotfiles/"

  - trigger: ";desk"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "open ~/Desktop"
```


A trigger to create and open a new file.
```yml
  - trigger: ";newfile"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: uuid
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "uuidgen"
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "cd ~/Desktop; touch {{uuid}}.md; open /Applications/CotEditor.app {{uuid}}.md"
```


A trigger to open YouTube. It opens in the default browser.
```yml
  - trigger: ";you"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "open 'https://www.youtube.com/'"
```


A trigger to Google search the content copied to the clipboard.
```yml
  - trigger: ";ggl"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: "clip"
        type: "clipboard"
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "open 'https://www.google.com/search?q={{clip}}'"
```


A trigger to switch VScode's `settings.json` configuration. In the following case, it switches the PDF Viewer color inversion setting of the `latex-workshop` extension between `"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert": 0` and `"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert": 1`.
```yml
  - trigger: ";invert"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: path
        type: echo
        params:
          echo: "~/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/settings.json"
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: |
            if grep -q "\"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert\": 1" {{path}};
            then sed -i '' 's/\"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert\": 1/\"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert\": 0/' {{path}};
            elif grep -q "\"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert\": 0" {{path}};
            then sed -i '' 's/\"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert\": 0/\"latex-workshop.view.pdf.invert\": 1/' {{path}};
            else echo "No matching pattern found.";
            fi
```


A trigger to convert a site copied to the clipboard via API to Markdown. (Not all sites are supported)
```yml
  - trigger: ";tomd"
    replace: |
            - Webpage to Markdown Conversion by https://urltomarkdown.herokuapp.com/
            - Source URL: {{clipboard}}
            - Conversion Timestamp: {{now}}
            
            ===================================================
            
            {{output}}
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: |
            curl "https://urltomarkdown.herokuapp.com/?url={{clipboard}}"
```


The next trigger is the essence of Espanso. Simply copy text to the clipboard and type `;jet`, and the English translation by Google Gemini will be inserted at the cursor position. Please use it after defining `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `global_vars`. You can define it in the same file, but be careful not to make it public when managing on GitHub. Get `GEMINI_API_KEY` from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)
```yml
global_vars:
  - name: GEMINI_API_KEY
    type: echo
    params:
      echo: "EmitDqIhb7Rzu5GheVtiwL452...."

matches:
  - trigger: ";jet"
    replace: "{{translation}}"
    vars:
      - name: "clip"
        type: "clipboard"
      - name: gemini_model
        type: echo
        params:
          echo: "gemini-2.5-flash"
      - name: translation
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: >
            curl -s \
              "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/{{gemini_model}}:generateContent" \
              -H "x-goog-api-key: {{GEMINI_API_KEY}}" \
              -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
              -X POST \
              -d '{
                    "contents": [{
                      "parts": [{"text": "Translate the following to English. Provide ONLY the translated text, no explanations or markdown: {{clip}}"}]
                    }]
                  }' \
            | jq -r '.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text | split("\n")[0]'
```

:::note
The jq command is required: `brew install jq`. It's used to parse JSON responses from the API.
:::

:::warning
If the above trigger returns an error, check [Google's documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) to see if the model `gemini-2.5-flash` is currently available. If there's no problem with the model name, check [the REST section of this page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart#rest) to see if the API calling method has been updated.
:::

:::tip
At the time of writing, the faster-responding model `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` is also available.
:::

:::tip
By changing the instructions (prompt), you can create all kinds of triggers, not just translation, such as proofreading, summarizing, refactoring, etc.
:::


## Script Extension
You can also execute external files and receive the results.

```py[title=/path/to/your/script.py]
print("Hello from python")
```

```yml[title=base.yml]
  - trigger: ";pyscript"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: script
        params:
          args:
            - python
            - /path/to/your/script.py
```


## Form Extension (Interactive Snippets)
You can generate forms from triggers and create sentences following templates.

```yml
  - trigger: ";greet"
    form: |
      Hey [[name]],
      Happy Birthday!
```

![screenshot.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/0d085e75-b23a-70af-604d-834d64d961d5.png)

The above form can also be expressed as follows:
```yml
# The above is equivalent to the following
  - trigger: ";_greet"
    replace: |
        Hey {{form.name}},
        Happy Birthday!
    vars:
      - name: "form"
        type: form
        params:
          layout: |
            Hey [[name]],
            Happy Birthday!
```

:::warning
In complex cases where you use both `variable` and `form` in the same trigger, it seems this notation is required for it to work.

### Creating Sentences from Email Template Forms
```yml
matches:
  - trigger: ";reply"
    form: |
        Hi, [[name]]
        
        Thank you for your email and for bringing this to our attention.
        I am sorry that you're disappointed with our product.
        
        [[choices]]

        Looking forward to hearing from you
        
        All the bestÔºå
        ABC Support Team
    form_fields:
      choices:
        type: choice
        values:
          - Could you please let me know what specific issues you've encountered?
          - sentence 2
          - sentence 3

### Creating Todo Items
```yml
  - trigger: ";todo"
    replace: "- Task: {{form1.task}}, Due Date: {{form1.day}} {{form1.time}}"
    vars:
      - name: "days"
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "for i in {0..6}; do date -v+${i}d '+%Y/%m/%d'; done"
      - name: "hours"
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "for i in {8..20}; do echo \"$i:00\"; done"
      - name: "form1"
        type: form
        params:
          layout: "Task: [[task]], Due Date: [[day]] [[time]]"
          fields:
            day:
              type: choice
              values: "{{days}}"
            time:
              type: choice
              values: "{{hours}}"
```

![SCR-20240618-qyki.png](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/414636/932694e0-8a4f-5c6d-8f57-d7bb38eca3de.png)


### Text Case Style Conversion
A powerful example combining forms and shell scripts. It converts clipboard text to the format selected in the form (camel case, snake case, etc.).
```yml
  - trigger: ";case"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: form
        type: form
        params:
          layout: "Convert clipboard to: [[style]]"
          fields:
            style:
              type: choice
              values: ["UPPERCASE", "lowercase", "PascalCase", "camelCase", "Title Case", "kebab-case", "snake_case"]
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: |
            text="{{clipboard}}"
            case "{{form.style}}" in
              "UPPERCASE")  echo "$text" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]';;
              "lowercase")  echo "$text" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]';;
              "PascalCase") echo "$text" | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) $i=toupper(substr($i,1,1)) tolower(substr($i,2));}1' | tr -d ' ';;
              "camelCase")  echo "$text" | awk '{out=tolower($1); for(i=2;i<=NF;i++){out=out toupper(substr($i,1,1)) tolower(substr($i,2))}; print out}';;
              "Title Case") echo "$text" | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) $i=toupper(substr($i,1,1)) tolower(substr($i,2));}1';;
              "kebab-case") echo "$text" | sed -E 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+//g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -s ' ' '-';;
              "snake_case") echo "$text" | sed -E 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+//g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -s ' ' '_';;
            esac
```


### Currency Conversion
```yml
  - trigger: ";currency"
    replace: "{{conversion}}"
    vars:
      - name: form
        type: form
        params:
          layout: |
                  Amount: [[amount]]
                  From: [[from]]
                  To: [[to]]
          fields:
            from:
              type: choice
              values: ["USD", "JPY", "CHF", "EUR", "GBP", "CNY", "KRW", "CAD", "AUD"]
            to:
              type: choice
              values: ["JPY", "USD", "EUR", "CHF", "GBP", "CNY", "KRW", "CAD", "AUD"]
      - name: conversion
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "curl -s 'https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{{form.from}}' | jq -r '.rates.{{form.to}} * {{form.amount}} | round * 100 / 100' | xargs printf '{{form.amount}} {{form.from}} = %.2f {{form.to}}\\n'"
```



## Summary
Espanso is not just a simple text replacement tool, but a powerful personal automation tool that dramatically improves the efficiency of daily PC work by leveraging shell scripts, external APIs, and interactive forms.

The examples introduced in this article are just a small part. Please find your own routine tasks and tedious work, and try automating them with Espanso.
